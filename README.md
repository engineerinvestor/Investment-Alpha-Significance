# Investment-Alpha-Significance

Welcome to the Investment-Alpha-Significance repository! This repository contains a Python notebook designed to visualize and analyze the years required for a fund manager to achieve statistically significant alpha relative to the standard deviation of returns.

## Overview
This project provides a detailed examination of the statistical challenges in proving that a fund manager can generate significant alpha over their career. Through heatmaps, the notebook illustrates the number of years needed to reach a t-statistic of 2 under various alpha and volatility scenarios, highlighting the impractical length of time needed for most fund managers to statistically justify their performance.

## Features
- **Heatmap Visualization**: Offers a clear and interactive way to see how changes in alpha and standard deviation affect the time required for statistical significance.
- **Parametric Analysis**: Users can adjust parameters to explore different scenarios and their implications on the duration for achieving significance.
- **Insightful Conclusions**: Provides conclusions that inform investment strategy, particularly around the effectiveness and practicality of active fund management.
